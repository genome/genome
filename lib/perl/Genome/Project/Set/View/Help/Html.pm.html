The project box lists some of your projects and the number of items they contain.
You can click on "see all" to see the full list (there is also a link on our main page http://imp/search).
From the full list, you can see a detailed view of a project where you can remove items.

If you would like someone else to be able to find a project easily, just search for them by user name
and drag them into the project. That project will now appear in their project list.
