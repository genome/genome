Moves allocations from one volume to another. Can specify a specific volume
to move them to or provide a group from which a volume will be selected.

If no volume or group is specified, then it will use the allocation's
disk_group_name as the target_group, the result being that the allocation
will be moved to another volume in the same group with enough free space to
hold it.
