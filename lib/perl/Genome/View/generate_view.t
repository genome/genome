#    Change the begavior of 'load' observers with autosubclassing objects
#    
#    Previously, the intent was to send a 'load' signal when the abstract parent
#    gets loaded, figure out the correct subclass, then send an 'unload' for the
#    parent, then send a 'load' for the child
#    
#    That wasn't what was happening, and it was causing infinite recursion with
#    certain Views when an encompassing view could have its generate_content()
#    triggered when an aspect's sub-view loads objects.
#    
#    The new behavior is to only send the 'load' signal for the subclassed
#    thing, and never send signals for the abstract, parent class thing
#
