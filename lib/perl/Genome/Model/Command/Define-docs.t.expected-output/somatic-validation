    --subject TEST-patient1-sample1 \
    --processing-profile name='my processing profile'

[4mREQUIRED INPUTS[0m
  [1mprocessing-profile[0m
    Processing profile to be used by model, can provide either a name or an ID 

[4mOPTIONAL INPUTS[0m
  [1madd-to-projects[0m
    add the new model to these projects (model groups) 
  [1minstrument-data[0m
    Instrument data to be assigned to the model, can provide a query to resolve, a list of ids, etc 
  [1msnv-variant-list[0m
    prior SNVs to be validated 
  [1msubject[0m
    Subject for the model, can provide either a name or an id. If instrument data is provided and
    this is not, an attempt will be made to resolve it based on the provided instrument data 
  [1mgroups[0m
    Model groups to put the newly created model into 
  [1mindel-variant-list[0m
    prior indels to be validated 
  [1mmodel-name[0m
    User meaningful name for this model, a default is used if none is provided 
  [1mnormal-sample[0m
    the control sample 
  [1mknown-sites[0m
    Build[s] of known variants to use in when refining with GATK best practices. 
  [1mprealigned-data[0m
    pre-built alignments for skipping the built-in alignment process 
  [1msv-variant-list[0m
    prior SVs to be validated 
  [1mreference-sequence-build[0m
    reference to which to align the instrument data 
  [1mrun-as[0m
    Specify who the model should run_as if run in production 
  [1mannotation-build[0m
    annotation data set to annotate the newly called variants 
  [1mpreviously-discovered-variations-build[0m
    build of variants to screen out from consideration (such as from dbSNP) 
  [1mtarget-region-set[0m
    target set of the instrument data 
  [1mregion-of-interest-set[0m
    the region of interest for coverage analysis 
  [1mdesign-set[0m
    the idealized region of interest as sent for probe design 
  [1mtumor-sample[0m
    the experimental sample 

[4mOPTIONAL PARAMS[0m
  [1mauto-assign-inst-data[0m
    Assigning instrument data to the model is performed automatically 
    Default value 'false' (--noauto-assign-inst-data) if not specified
  [1mnoauto-assign-inst-data[0m
    Make auto-assign-inst-data 'false' 
  [1mauto-build-alignments[0m
    The building of the model is performed automatically 
    Default value 'true' if not specified
  [1mnoauto-build-alignments[0m
    Make auto-build-alignments 'false' 

[4mDESCRIPTION[0m
    This defines a new genome model for the specified subject, using the specified processing
    profile.
